          There are many reasons you may have found yourself here...Perhaps you
          feel stuck in a cycle of difficult emotions or thoughts that have
          become intrusive and overwhelming. Maybe you have come to a point in
          your life that you would like to see yourself in a different light or
          you just need some extra support. Whatever change you would like to
          experience, I am here to help support you in finding the relief that
          you are looking for.

          I am a psychotherapist with a passion. My goal is to create a safe,
          non-judgemental space to explore challenges and find solutions with
          you. It can feel scary and uncomfortable reaching out for support, but
          it is an amazing step towards prioritizing yourself and your mental
          health.
